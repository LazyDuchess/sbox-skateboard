# Skateboard
 WIP Pro Skater clone for S&Box. Based on THUG2 physics and gameplay.

# Map making
Making custom skateable maps.
## Tags
* "vert" - For transition - quarter pipes, pools, etc. Makes skater stick to it when airing off. Also makes it skateable regardless of steepness.
* "skateable" - Makes a surface skateable regardless of how steep it is. Used for loops, for example, though the steeper it is the more speed you need to stick to the surface.
* "unskateable" - The opposite of skateable, makes surfaces unskateable regardless of steepness.
## Entities
* "grind_path" - Grindable path, not yet functional in-game. Displays as a bezier path in hammer, but will be linear in-game.
